## Interrupt Handlers

## Softirqs

The number of softirqs is decided at compile time. There are only `NR_SOFTIRQS` (defined in [`linux/interrupt.h`](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.1.65/source/include/linux/interrupt.h#L561)) softirqs in the kernel.

Softirqs are rarely used directly, only few subsystems (ex. networking and block devices) are using it. Alternatively, tasklets and timers that are built on top of softirqs (`TASKLET_SOFTIRQ` and `TIMER_SOFTIRQ`) are more common to use.

Softirqs never preempt each other, only hardware interrupts can preempt them, that is to say, the hardware interrupts won't be disabled on the current processor while it is handling softirqs.

Softirq handlers are executed in interrupt context (cannot sleep). While a handler is executed on a processor, the softirqs on that processor will be disabled, however, other processors can still execute the same softirq, which means the softirq handler can run simultaneously, and therefore needs proper locking.
